# RL from scratch

Reinforcement Learning is a subfield of machine learning that deals with training agents to make decisions based on rewards and punishments. Unlike supervised learning, where the agent is trained using labeled data, in reinforcement learning, the agent learns through trial and error.

This repository contains implementations of fundamentals reinforcement learning from scratch. By implementing these, you will gain a deeper understanding of how they work. The code are written in Python and use popular libraries such as OpenAI Gym, PyTorch
